state 1

    (0) S' -> expression .



state 2

    (1) expression -> OPERATION . NUMBER NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 3


state 3

    (1) expression -> OPERATION NUMBER . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 4


state 4

    (1) expression -> OPERATION NUMBER NUMBER .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (expression -> OPERATION NUMBER NUMBER .)
